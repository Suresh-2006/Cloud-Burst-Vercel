# Cloudburst Prediction using Machine Learning (XGBoost)

## Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of a cloudburst or heavy rainfall using advanced machine learning techniques powered by XGBoost.
The model uses real meteorological data containing parameters like temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall, and wind to identify patterns that indicate possible cloudburst conditions.

The system includes:

* A trained XGBoost model with tuned hyperparameters
* A Flask-based web interface for real-time prediction
* An intuitive frontend that displays clear results such as

  * High Chance of Cloudburst
  * Possible Heavy Rain
  * No Cloudburst Expected

This project was developed for the IBM Z Datathon 2025 by Team Datanauts (SAV241) from Saveetha Engineering College.

## Dataset Information

The dataset (cloudburst_data.csv) contains multiple meteorological observations and environmental factors used to train the model.
It includes the following key features:

| Feature                                     | Description                                |

## Model Training and Optimization

The machine learning pipeline includes several critical steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
   Missing values are filled with column means.
   The target variable CloudBurstTomorrow is encoded into binary classes (1 = Cloudburst, 0 = No Cloudburst).

2. Feature Engineering
   Derived new metrics like temperature range, humidity ratio, and pressure variation.
   Added seasonal and day-based encodings to capture temporal trends.

3. Feature Scaling
   StandardScaler was used to normalize continuous features for XGBoost compatibility.

4. Model Building (XGBoost)
   The XGBoost classifier was trained using a balanced scale_pos_weight to address class imbalance.
   Hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV over 75 combinations and 3 folds, resulting in 225 total fits.
   Training was executed efficiently on a LinuxONE environment.

5. Performance Metrics
   Base Accuracy: 85.3 percent
   After threshold optimization: 90.2 percent
   Significant improvement observed in precision and recall for cloudburst event detection.

## Model Saving and Deployment

After training and evaluation, the best model and scaler were saved using:

```python
joblib.dump(best_model, "cloudburst_model.pkl")
joblib.dump(scaler, "scaler.pkl")
```

These files are later loaded by the Flask app for real-time predictions.

## Flask Web Application Overview

The web application enables users to input real-world weather parameters and instantly receive predictions.

How it works:

1. The user enters weather details.
2. The Flask backend loads the trained XGBoost model.
3. Input values are preprocessed and scaled.
4. The model outputs a cloudburst probability.
5. The result is displayed dynamically with a weather-themed interface.
